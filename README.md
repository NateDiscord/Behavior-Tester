# Behavior-Tester
Behavior-Tester is a development tool designed to facilitate the real-time testing and previewing of custom game behaviors within a client-server setup. By allowing developers to visualize and iterate on their custom behaviors without the need for frequent server restarts, this tool significantly accelerates the development cycle.

# Key Features
* Initialization: Quick and easy setup to get your testing environment up and running.
* Resource Management: Efficiently manage your Maps, Behaviors, Textures, and XML files through the Resources folder.
* Modular Testing: Includes modules like Projectile and Map Configuration in the Modules folder for comprehensive testing scenarios.
* Network Branch: Establish and test network interactions without restarting the server.
* Player Branch: Configure and test player-specific behaviors and interactions dynamically.
* Behavior Cycle Logic: Validate and refine behavior cycles with immediate feedback during runtime.

# Requirements
* Server: Ensure your server instance is running to handle game logic and network interactions.
* Client: Launch the client application to interact with and test the behaviors in real-time.
